# International Artificial Intelligence Olympiad - Preparation

## Overview

This repository contains my preparation materials for the **International Artificial Intelligence Olympiad (IAIO) 2024**, held in **Riyadh, Saudi Arabia**. My work focused on a variety of **Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV)** projects, as well as theoretical study materials.&#x20;

## Notable Work

The preparation covered key concepts such as handling missing data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, optimization techniques, hyperparameter tuning, outlier detection, and model evaluation. Additionally, I worked on computer vision, text classification, and sentiment analysis tasks, applying advanced techniques to improve model performance. Through this effort, I achieved a bronze medal for Romania at the competition.

Some key projects in this repository include American Sign Language recognition using PyTorch, brain anomaly detection through ConvNN, sentiment analysis with RoBERTa, and transformer-based regression models. Additionally, the repository contains competition-related datasets, theoretical materials, and solutions to various AI challenges from kaggle.com and zindi.africa.
